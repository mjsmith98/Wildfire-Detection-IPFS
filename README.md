# Wildfire-Detection-IPFS

This is a notebook that retrieves data from the NIFC wildfire api that covers the United States. 
I use this data to alert me on wildfires across the country using gmail.
To use this notebook you will need to create your own google credentials at https://developers.google.com/.
I use IPFS to store the data which I will then use to track fire growth/containment and send updates to myself. 
In this update it provides me a map of all existing fires within the US at that current time.

The website can be found here: https://www.nifc.gov/

This project is built with Physical Asset Security/Emergency responder sectors in mind and I am looking to expand to tracking globlally.
